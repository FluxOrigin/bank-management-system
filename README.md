# Python Bank Management System

This project is a console-based bank management system implemented in Python.

It demonstrates:

- Object-oriented design (`BankUtility`, `CoinCollector`, `Account`, `Bank`, `BankManager`)
- Input validation and error handling
- ATM withdrawals with fee handling
- Deposits, withdrawals, transfers, interest calculations
- Coin parsing utility for change deposits
- Doctest-based validation for core methods

## How to Run

```bash
python python bank_management_system.py
